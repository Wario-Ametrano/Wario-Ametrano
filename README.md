## Hi there 👋

I'm [Mario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-ametrano-a75a38229/) a QA Automation Engineer based in Italy 🇮🇹.

I bridge the gap between development and testing.

I try to do everything I can to improve my tests and the software. Sometimes I even try to do the impossible, but it doesn't always work. I always have a lot of projects I'm working on, and I really like the open source world.

I have many repos here on github of projects and courses I've worked on, if you want you can take a look and get inspiration or give an opinion.

🦖 Fun Facts:

- I like the 3D world
- I often create mods for Doom and Quake
- I really like walking in nature
- Hobbies: gym,play guitar,anime,building things
