## Hi there 👋

I'm [Mario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-ametrano-a75a38229/) a QA Automation Engineer based in Italy. 🇮🇹

I bridge the gap between development and testing.🎭

I try to do everything I can to improve my tests and the software. Sometimes I even try to do the impossible, but it doesn't always work. I always have a lot of projects I'm working on, and I really like the open source world.


Sometimes I also like to make videos about my projects.

I have many repositories here on GitHub with projects and courses I’ve worked on. If you’d like, you can take a look, get some inspiration, or share your thoughts.

🦖 Fun Facts:
- I like the 3D world
- I often create mods for Doom and Quake
- I really like walking in nature
- Hobbies: gym,play guitar,anime,building things
